//Generic Math Support: This feature allows you to perform mathematical operations on generic types, like when you're trying to figure out how much pizza to order for a party.

var count = Math.Max(10, 20);
//Joke: "Why did the math book look sad? Because it had too many problems"
//Explanation: With this new feature you can use mathematical operations on different types, like int, float, double etc.

//Numeric IntPtr and UIntPtr: These new types allow you to work with pointer-sized integers, like when you're trying to remember someone's phone number but it's too big to fit in your head.

IntPtr num = (IntPtr)1000;

//Joke: "Why did the computer go to the doctor? it had a pointer problem"
//Explanation: These new types allow you to work with large integers that are the size of a pointer, which could be useful for memory-intensive applications.


//Auto - default struct: This feature allows you to create structs with default values without having to explicitly specify them, like when you're ordering a sandwich and you don't have to specify all the toppings because they come with it by default.
class test1
{
    public test1()
    {
        var sandwich = new Sandwich(); // sandwich.Bread and sandwich.Mayonnaise are both set to their default values.

    }
    struct Sandwich { public int Bread; public bool Mayonnaise; }

}
//Joke: "Why did the sandwich go to the doctor? It was feeling bread."
//Explanation: With this new feature you can create struct with default values without having to specify them.




//Pattern match Span<char> or ReadOnlySpan<char> on a constant string: This feature allows you to perform pattern matching on strings, like when you're trying to find a specific song in a playlist.


class Test2
{
    public Test2()
    {

        string song = "song1";
        if (song is var s && s.Length > 0)
            Console.WriteLine($"The song {s} has a length greater than 0.");
    }
}
//Joke: "Why did the string go to the gym? to get fit."
//Explanation: With this new feature you can perform pattern matching on strings, you can check if the string matches a certain pattern and perform an action based on that.


//Extended nameof scope: This feature allows you to use the nameof operator to refer to members of a class, like when you're trying to remember the name of your friend's dog.


class Test3
{
    public Test3()
    {
        var dog = new Dog { Name = "Fido" };
        Console.WriteLine(nameof(dog.Name)); // "Name"


    }
    class Dog
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
    }
}


//Joke: "Why did the dog go to the class? to learn a new name."
//Explanation: With this new feature you can use the nameof operator to refer to the members of a class, this could be useful for debugging and error handling.

//I hope these examples help illustrate the new features in a relatable way, and also the jokes helped to lighten up the mood.
